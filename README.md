A browser-based, word guessing game: "Phrase Hunter." 

Game Rules: 
Each time the player guesses a letter, the letter the player has chosen will be compared to the random phrase. If the letter is in the phrase, the gameboard displays the chosen letters on the screen.

The player continues to select letters until they guess the phrase (and win), or make five incorrect guesses (and lose).

If the player completes the phrase before they run out of guesses, the player wins. If the player guesses incorrectly five times, the player loses.

- Note: A player can guess a letter only once.
